# Useful files and funcion
    fen_string_convert.py -> contains many useful functions for converting between softmax output and truthboard/
    See comments of get_truncated_board to see how format of softmax output

    uncertainty_rnn.py
        BoardGuesserNet -> networks that take in emission matrix and output softmaxes

    analyze_game.py -> contains an example of how to load in neural network weights and use it to predict the truth board
